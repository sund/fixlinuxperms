## fixlinuxperms
=============

a script that fixes linux files permission based on package (.rpm or .deb) data

After a slight **D'oh** on changing permissions on the wrong directory, I found the ```fixperms.sh``` out on the internet which helped a bit. I figured I won't be the last person to make a mistake with ```chown -r``` (or with ```chmod```). I figure this would be the best place to put this script in the public and allow for contributions.

This should mimic Mac OS X's 'Fix Permissions' in Disk Utility.
